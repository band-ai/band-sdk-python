# Managed Host Adapter Configuration

Managed hosts keep their own profile data and pass the supported settings to the
adapter at construction. This page is the cross-adapter reference for that
projection; each adapter guide remains the reference for its other settings.

| Adapter | Construction | Custom instructions | Model | Reasoning / thinking |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude SDK | `ClaudeSDKAdapter(...)` | `custom_section` | `model` | `effort` and `max_thinking_tokens` |
| Codex | `CodexAdapter(config=CodexAdapterConfig(...))` | `custom_section` | `model` | `reasoning_effort`; `max_thinking_tokens` is N/A |
| Copilot SDK | `CopilotSDKAdapter(CopilotSDKAdapterConfig(...))` | `custom_section` | `model` | `reasoning_effort`; `max_thinking_tokens` is N/A |
| OpenCode | `OpencodeAdapter(config=OpencodeAdapterConfig(...))` | `custom_section` | `provider_id` and `model_id` | `variant`; `reasoning_effort` and `max_thinking_tokens` are N/A |

See [OpenCode Integration](opencode.md#opencode-variants) for the `variant` field's semantics and a runnable example.
